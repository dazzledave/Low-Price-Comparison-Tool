# Price Alerts Feature - Setup Guide

## Overview
The Price Alerts feature allows users to set up automated price monitoring for products across all supported stores (Jumia, Melcom, CompuGhana, Amazon). When a product's price drops to or below your target price, you'll receive an email notification.

## Features

### âœ… What's Working:
- **Create Price Alerts**: Set target prices for products
- **Email Notifications**: Receive alerts when target prices are reached
- **Automated Monitoring**: Background service checks prices every 6 hours
- **Manual Price Checks**: Test the system with manual price checking
- **Alert Management**: Activate/deactivate/delete alerts
- **Multi-Store Support**: Monitor prices across all supported stores

### ðŸ”§ Setup Required:
- **Email Configuration**: Configure SMTP settings for notifications
- **Database**: SQLite database stores all alerts

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Email Configuration

Edit `config.py` with your email provider details:

```python
# Gmail (Recommended)
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'  # Gmail App Password

# Or use Outlook/Hotmail
# EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp-mail.outlook.com'
# EMAIL_PORT = 587
# EMAIL_USER = 'your-email@outlook.com'
# EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup (Recommended)

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account Settings â†’ Security â†’ App Passwords
3. Generate an app password for "Mail"
4. Use this password in `config.py`

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install schedule
```

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
python mainapp.py
```

The price monitoring service will start automatically in the background.

## How It Works

### Creating Price Alerts

1. **Navigate to Price Alerts**: Go to `/price-alerts` in your browser
2. **Fill the Form**:
   - Product Name: Name of the product you want to monitor
   - Current Price: Current price of the product
   - Target Price: Price you want to be notified about
   - Store: Which store the product is from
   - Product Link: URL to the product page
   - Email: Your email for notifications (optional)

3. **Submit**: The alert will be created and start monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

- **Frequency**: Checks prices every 6 hours (configurable)
- **Process**: Uses existing scrapers to get current prices
- **Notifications**: Sends email when target price is reached
- **Auto-Deactivation**: Alerts are automatically deactivated after triggering

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a Test Alert**: Set a target price higher than current price
2. **Manual Check**: Click "Check Prices Now" button
3. **Verify**: Check console logs for monitoring activity

## Configuration Options

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# Monitoring Settings
PRICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS = 6  # How often to check prices
MAX_PRICE_CHECKS_PER_RUN = 10   # Max alerts to check per run
DELAY_BETWEEN_CHECKS = 2        # Seconds between checks

# Email Settings
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
```

## Database Schema

The `price_alerts` table stores:

- `id`: Unique alert ID
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `target_price`: Target price for notification
- `current_price`: Current price (for reference)
- `product_link`: URL to the product
- `store`: Store name (Jumia, Melcom, etc.)
- `email`: User's email for notifications
- `is_active`: Whether alert is active (1) or inactive (0)
- `created_at`: When alert was created

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check email configuration in `config.py`
2. Verify app password is correct
3. Check console logs for SMTP errors

### Price Checks Not Working
1. Verify scrapers are working
2. Check console logs for scraping errors
3. Test manual price check button

### Alerts Not Triggering
1. Ensure target price is lower than current price
2. Check if product is still available on the store
3. Verify store name matches exactly

## API Endpoints

- `POST /create-price-alert`: Create new price alert
- `POST /delete-price-alert/<id>`: Delete price alert
- `POST /deactivate-price-alert/<id>`: Deactivate alert
- `POST /check-price-alerts`: Manual price check
- `GET /price-alerts`: View all alerts

## Security Notes

- Store email passwords securely
- Use app passwords instead of regular passwords
- Consider environment variables for production
- Monitor email sending limits

## Future Enhancements
